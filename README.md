## Brief

Plan, design and implement a solution for automating the development workflows and deployments for the spring pet clinic application. It must have multi environment support and automatically build and deploy to test and live environments when changes are made and oushed to github. The costs for the project need to be calculated and all tools to be used must be chosen by us.

### CI Pipeline

### Trello Project Tracking

Using Trello, we tracked the project along the way with a Kanban style board which allowed us to see the progress and things that need to be done. Here is the inital board which shows the tasks that need to be done, some that are already in progress and others that had already been done such as setting up github. Our first sprint has also been outlined:

This is the board throughout the project when some things were in progress and others completed.

In the final board everything is complete apart from the documentation to which we are adding finishing touches.

## MoSCoW

### Must Have
* Kanban style board for project tracking
* Version control system using the feature branch model to implement developing code
* CI server to automatically build and deploy software to a cloud hosted machine
* Docker for containerisation
* Docker swarm for container orchestration 
* Ansible for configuring and deploying the application
* 4 micro services which work together, are load balanced and replicated throughout nodes in order to stay up whilst being updated

### Should Have
* Clear and detailed documentation showing progress throughout the project and testing
* The applciation provides an outcome dependant on rules
* Designs for the project before it is started
* Webhooks so that jenkins can build instantly when github has been updated

### Could Have
* More complicated service which asks for user input as well as providing the user with a generated output
* Full CRUD funcionality
* Security through proper firewall use and changing of passwords

### Wont Have
* Extra functionality allowing people to up or down vote the usernames that they get so that more popular name combinations can be provided
* Fully integrated autoamtic testing with 100% coverage


## Risk Assessment

In my risk assessment I have listed possible risks with the project. I added the risks cause and effect as well as the likelihood of it happening, this is then followed by a control measure which can help negate the risk and give it a lower likelihood and consequence. 

![Risk Assessment](https://github.com/oskar951/SFIA2/blob/master/Images/RiskAssessment1.jpg)

I then reviewed my risks towards the end of the project to see which control measures are implemented and whether I avoided those risks or not.

Here is my Risk Matrix with some of them added in:
